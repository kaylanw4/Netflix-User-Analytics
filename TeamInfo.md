## Project Summary

Netflix Wrapped is a web-based application that aims to provide users with personalized insights into their Netflix viewing habits, similar to the “Spotify Wrapped” concept. Users will be able to input their Netflix history and get a variety of metrics, such as favorite genres, total number of hours watched, which month had the most hours viewed, etc. The goal is to offer a fun and interesting look into a user’s entertainment consumption on Netflix, allowing them to discover trends and patterns in their viewing habits.
